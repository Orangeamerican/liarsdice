Go to localhost:3000
Click play then click join in order to get into the lobby for all six players.

Once all six players join, they will all be given their dice and game will autostart.
You can begin bidding from the first player. You can call, bid, or say spot on after a player bids.
If a player calls, the player who calls will always go next.

You can play the game all the way through and it will tell you when players lose or when a player wins!
